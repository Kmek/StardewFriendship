# StardewFriendship
A website for understanding the friendship mechanics in Stardew Valley

The Stardew Valley [wiki](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Friendship) was used for exact numbers

### Brainstorm:
- Some measurement ideas:
   - How long it takes to max out friendship
   - How long it takes to gain a heart
   - How many days of talking is equivalent to a liked gift? loved gift?
- Things to consider:
   - Talking during a special animation (half as much as regular talking)
   - Quality of the gift
   - Loved, liked, neutral, disliked, hated
   - Special events:
      - Winter star multiplier (x5)
      - Birthday multiplier (x8)
      - The Luau (increase or decrease all friendships)
      - The Flower Dance increases friendship by 1 heart for whoever you dance with
   - Random help wanted item delivery quests (rewards 150 pts)
   - Heart animation choices (sometimes rewards varying points)
   - Decay (Varies for friendship level / types)
      - Decay eventually stops, unless married
      - Friendship doesn't decrease below 0
   - Each heart is worth 250 points

### Calculus Todos: 
- [x] Equation, second and third deriv
- [ ] Critical values
- [x] Extrema
- [ ] Concavity
- [ ] Inflection points
- [x] X-intercept
- [x] Y-intercept

### Other Todos:
- [ ] Recenter desmos graph closer for `r(x)` and `a(x)` (pass parameters to `setMathBoundsDesmos()`)
- [ ] Don't forget to either fill in or remove the `PrismJS` codeblock in the `Models` section
- [ ] Move graph output `<p>` up to below graph button
- [ ] Move 3 show equation buttons `<div>` above the "chosen situation" `<div>`
