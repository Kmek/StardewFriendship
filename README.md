# StardewFriendship
A website for understanding the freindship mechanics in Stardew Valley

### Brainstorm:
- Some measurement ideas:
   - How long it takes to max out friendship
   - How long it takes to gain a heart
   - How many days of talking is equivalent to a liked gift? loved gift?
- Things to consider:
   - Talking during a special animation (half as much as regular talking)
   - Quality of the gift
   - Loved, liked, neutral, disliked, hated
   - Special events:
      - Winter star multiplier (x5)
      - Birthday multiplier (x8)
      - The Luau (increase or decrease all friendships)
      - The Flower Dance increases friendship by 1 heart for whoever you dance with
   - Random help wanted item delivery quests (rewards 150 pts)
   - Heart animation choices (sometimes rewards varying points)
   - Decay (Varies for friendship level / types)
      - Decay eventually stops, unless married
      - Friendship doesn't decrease below 0
   - Each heart is worth 250 points
- Use the [wiki](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Friendship) for exact numbers
